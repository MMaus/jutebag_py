# Jutebag Python backend

# Set up

You need to create the directory

     cred/

and place a firebase admin credential json file with the name

     jutebag-py-firebase-cred.json

into that directory.

If you want to run the tests, you need to place another credential file in

     test/test_cred/

with the same name

     jutebag-py-firebase-cred.json
